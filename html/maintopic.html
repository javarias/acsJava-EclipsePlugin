<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The ACS Java Eclipse Plugin was designed to keep track, on you Eclipse Java project, the
different set of libraries used during ACS Java module development (<b>ACSROOT</b>, <b>INTLIST</b> and <b>INTROOT</b>).</p>

<p>This Plugin will read the interesting files (.jar and .zip) from the ACS know directory structures and put them as dependencies of
your project. However this plugin does not take care of the import order of the Java Build Path, the the user must set this up as required.</p>

<h1>Setting up the libraries</h1>
Once this plugin is installed, a new preference item will show up in the preferences window.<br/>

Clicking in the <i>Installed ACS versions</i> item will display the following panel: <br/>

Adding a library of any type is easy. You need to click in any <i>Add Library</i> 
button to display a new wizard to help you to select a directory containing the ACS and/or ACS related binaries. <br/>

The name of the directory selected will automatically set based on the last path segment. This is user modifiable, though. </br>

<h1>Setting up ACS libraries in your Java project</h1>
<p>Once the libraries has been setup properly in the Eclipse preferences. Then it is possible to setup the libraries used
to build a Java project based upon ACS.</p>
<p>In this example an Java Project called <i>DC</i> will be created from existing sources. Originally this project is based on ACS and it 
require a ACSROOT and a INTLIST to build correctly.</p>

<p>Adding ACS libraries is straightforward since it is integrated with Eclipse JDT framework. To add a new library dependency to the project 
do the following: <b>get properties for the project</b>, in the properties window click in the <b>Java Build Path</b> list item, then click
in the <b>Libraries</b> tab and finally click in the <b>Add Library...</b> button. The following Dialog will show up:</p>
<center><img alt="Add library JDT dialog" src="images/add-lib-dialog.png"></center> 
<p>Additionally to the regular options a new set of three options is presented:
<ul>
<li>ACS Installation Directory</li>
<li>ACS INSTLIST Directory</li>
<li>ACS INTROOT Directory</li> 
</ul>
For this project it is necessary to add an <i>ACS Installation Directory</i> and an <i>ACS INTLIST Directory</i>.
Selecting ACS Installation Directory and then next, will show up the previously setup ACS installation list.<br/>

<p>Selecting the ACS installation and then finish will add to project Libraries the selected ACS installation directory. </br>
<center><img alt="ACS added" src="images/acs-added.png"></center>
<p>The same procedure must be followed for any INTLIST and INTROOT that need to be added to the project. </p>
<p>Remember to set the right order for these libraries, first the INTROOT, then the INTLIST, the the ACSROOT and at the end the JVM.
The user can add more jars, and other libraries. the order how to setup them is responsibility of the user.<p>

<p>At the end the project should build ok.</p>
